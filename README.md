Vrinda Store Annual Sales Report  üìä
Welcome to the Vrinda Store Annual Sales Report  GitHub repository! This project marks my first foray into creating an Excel Dashboard, and I'm excited to share the insights and analysis I've gathered from this endeavor. üéâ

Project Overview
Project Name: Vrinda Store Annual Sales Report 

Objective: The main goal of this project was to delve into the sales data of Vrinda Store üè¨, in order to assist them in comprehending their customers' preferences and boosting sales for the upcoming year üìà.

Steps Followed
Here's a brief overview of the steps I followed to achieve this objective:

Data Extraction: I started by extracting data from an Excel (.xlsx) file.
Data Cleaning: Data cleaning is vital for accurate analysis. I ensured there were no inconsistencies or empty values in the dataset.
Data Processing: I added two essential columns: 'Age Group' and 'Month,' which are highlighted in yellow.
Data Analysis: Utilizing Pivot Tables, I unearthed valuable insights such as sales patterns, trends, order channels, and more. I also performed actions like removing duplicates, null value handling, and data visualization using slicers and charts.
Excel Dashboard Design
The Excel Dashboard I created incorporates the following key elements:

Pivot tables
Static tables
Dynamic charts
Auto-shape objects
Gauge widgets
Other non-chart widgets
The layout and arrangement of these components play a significant role in the dashboard's appearance and readability.

Insights
Here are some key insights derived from the analysis:

The highest sales were recorded in the month of March.
Women constituted the largest customer segment, contributing to 64% of sales.
The age group of 30-49 years made the most purchases, accounting for approximately 50% of sales.
Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra were the top-performing sales channels.
States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh stood out as the top-performing regions in 2022.
An impressive 92% of orders were marked as 'Delivered.'
Conclusion
To enhance sales for Vrinda Store, the following recommendations can be made:

Target Female Customers: Focus on female customers in the 30-49 age group residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Utilize advertising, coupons, discounts, offers, and other value-added services available on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart to attract this demographic.
